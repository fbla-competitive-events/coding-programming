**Due-date:**

## Overview

Develop a database program to manage the issuance of books at a school library. Give the school a name. 
The program must be able to complete a minimum of the following tasks:
* Track student and teacher names with ability to enter/view/edit names.
* Track the issuance of books for a student or teacher.
* Manage different limits for the number of books that can be issued to a student or teacher.
* Manage the number of days that students and teachers can check out any book. (Hint: Mostly like the number of days
will differ for students and teachers).
* Give each book a different ID. Also, each book of same name and same author (but number of copies) will have 
different ID.
* Generate/print weekly report to show books issued to whom and number of days leading to the due date return.
* Generate/print weekly report of detail of fines (when book not returned on time).

## Specific Guidelines

* The program must run on Windows XP or higher.
* Solution must run standalone with no programming errors.
* Data must be free of viruses/malware. Any entry with contaminated data will not be judged.
* The program should be shown to the judges.
