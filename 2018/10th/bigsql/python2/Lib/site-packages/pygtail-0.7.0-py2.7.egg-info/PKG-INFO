Description: pygtail
        =======
        
        A python "port" of `logcheck's logtail2 <http://logcheck.org>`__.
        
        Pygtail reads log file lines that have not been read. It will even
        handle log files that have been rotated.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        From the command line:
        
        ::
        
            Usage: pygtail.py [options] logfile
        
            Print log file lines that have not been read.
        
            Options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -o OFFSET_FILE, --offset-file=OFFSET_FILE
                                    File to which offset data is written (default:
                                    <logfile>.offset).
              -p, --paranoid        Update the offset file every time we read a line
                                    (as opposed to only when we reach the end of the
                                    file).
              -n N, --every-n=N     Update the offset file every N'th time we read a
                                    line (as opposed to only when we reach the end of
                                    the file).
              --no-copytruncate     Don't support copytruncate-style log rotation.
                                    Instead, if the log file shrinks, print a warning.
        
        In your code:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from pygtail import Pygtail
        
            for line in Pygtail("some.log"):
                sys.stdout.write(line)
